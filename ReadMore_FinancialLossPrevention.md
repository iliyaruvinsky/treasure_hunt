# Financial Loss Prevention

## What?

Financial Loss Prevention focuses on detecting and stopping fraud, theft, and unauthorized financial transactions across Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, Treasury Management, Expense Management, Vendor Payments, Customer Billing, Inventory Valuation, Asset Transfers, and Investment Activities. This area helps prevent direct financial losses across multiple fraud vectors: can detect vendor payment diversions before money leaves your account, may identify material conversion fraud before inventory theft occurs, supports early detection of unauthorized transaction patterns, helps prevent backdated approval schemes, and assists in maintaining financial transaction integrity across all financial modules.

## Why?

Financial losses occur when fraudulent activities, unauthorized transactions, or payment scheme manipulations go undetected until significant damage occurs. For example, vendor payment fraud might involve bank account changes followed by quick reversals, material conversions from high-value to low-value items enabling theft, or one-time vendor abuse with regular vendor banking details. When any one of these fraud patterns succeeds, it typically results in direct financial losses, investigation costs, and potential reputation damage across your organization.

## How?

AI-trained fraud detection algorithms continuously analyze financial transaction patterns across your SAP environment, automatically identifying suspicious activities that deviate from normal business patterns, and alerting finance teams for immediate investigation. Risk-free implementation: read-only monitoring with no system impact, secure connection typically established within days.
