## What Are The Problems (Vulnerabilities) - Why You Need Treasure Hunt

SAP environments face critical vulnerabilities that organizations often don't discover until significant damage occurs:

*Business Protection Vulnerabilities:*

- *Fraud Risks*: Material conversions, vendor payment diversions, backdated transactions, one-time vendor misuse, artificial purchase order splitting
- *Cybersecurity Threats*: Unauthorized access, data breaches, malicious activities, privilege escalation, critical authorization violations

*Business Control Gaps:*

- *Process Bottlenecks*: Stuck workflows, inefficient operations, resource waste, open purchase orders aging beyond 60 days
- *Business Anomalies*: Unusual patterns, irregular activities, process deviations, exceptional postings by GL account
- *Operational Inefficiencies*: IDOC processing failures, maintenance orders not completed, deliveries not billed after goods issue

*Access Governance Issues:*

- *Authorization Violations*: Segregation of duties breaches, excessive privileges, purchase orders approved by creator
- *Compliance Failures*: Regulatory violations, audit findings, risk exposure, conflicting role assignments
- *User Activity Risks*: Unauthorized access patterns, critical transaction usage violations

*Technical Control Weaknesses:*

- *System Instability*: Application dumps (ST22), processing errors, performance issues, prolonged locks (SM12)
- *Infrastructure Problems*: Resource constraints, communication failures, technical anomalies, failed background jobs (SM37)
- *Database Issues*: Update request failures (SM13), database inconsistencies

*Jobs Control Deficiencies:*

- *Processing Delays*: Long-running jobs, resource bottlenecks, performance degradation, job overlap with system peak times
- *Operational Inefficiencies*: Failed processes, system overload, productivity loss, redundant or obsolete jobs
- *Resource Management*: Work process depletion, memory and CPU contention, elongated job execution times

*S/4HANA Excellence Risks:*

- *Migration Issues*: Data inconsistencies, process failures, system vulnerabilities during transition
- *Post-Implementation Problems*: Configuration errors, performance issues, business continuity risks
- *User Adoption Challenges*: New interface adaptation, changed workflows, process flow modifications

## What Is Treasure Hunt

Treasure Hunt is Skywind's expert-guided diagnostic methodology that leverages Skywind's automated detection technology to reveal fraud, bottlenecks, and compliance gaps hidden in your SAP production data. Unlike traditional assessments, Treasure Hunt delivers immediate, actionable findings that expose real-time and historical issues requiring attention—serving as both an eye-opening initial diagnosis and the gateway to continuous SAP monitoring.

*Core Concept:*

- A 4-week structured assessment that connects securely to your SAP environment
- Real-time analysis of your actual SAP data, not simulated scenarios
- Historical analysis revealing data inconsistencies and discrepancies with detailed explanations
- Discovery of hidden risks, fraud indicators, and process inefficiencies using AI-augmented analytics
- Hands-on experience with the Skywind 4C™ platform in your specific business context

The entire setup process is remarkably straightforward for clients. We simply ask basic questions about your SAP environment through an Initial Qualification Questionnaire covering:

- SAP solutions currently in use (S/4HANA, ECC, BW, CRM, SRM)
- Number of productive SAP instances
- Default logon language for monitored systems
- Specific company codes, plants, or organizations to prioritize
- SAP modules implemented and critical business processes
- Master data and transactional data requirements
- Security and authorization frameworks
- Technical architecture details

Clients can answer these fundamental questions within just a few minutes, and our automated diagnostic process begins immediately based on your responses.

*Key Differentiators:*

- *Real Data Analysis*: Uses your actual SAP transactions, master data, and system logs
- *No-Risk Implementation*: Operates as read-only monitoring without impacting your SAP system performance
- *Immediate Value*: Identifies actual issues in your environment during the evaluation period
- *Comprehensive Coverage*: Monitors technical, business, fraud, and compliance aspects simultaneously using pre-configured Best Practices catalog with 20-30 controls typically implemented per PoC
