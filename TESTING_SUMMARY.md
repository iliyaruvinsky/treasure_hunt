# Testing Summary & Quick Reference

## 🎯 Answer to Your Questions

### 1. What's the Plan for Next Steps?

**Current Status:** All core features are implemented ✅

**Next Steps Priority:**

1. **IMMEDIATE (This Week):**
   - Test the system with real Skywind files
   - Fix any bugs discovered
   - Verify all components work together

2. **SHORT TERM (Next 2 Weeks):**
   - Add error handling and validation
   - Improve UI/UX based on testing
   - Add authentication/security
   - Set up monitoring

3. **MEDIUM TERM (Next Month):**
   - Train ML models with real data
   - Optimize performance
   - Add advanced features
   - Production deployment

See [NEXT_STEPS.md](NEXT_STEPS.md) for detailed roadmap.

### 2. How to Test Your Work?

**Three Testing Options:**

#### Option 1: Quick Test (10 minutes) ⚡
Follow [QUICK_TEST.md](QUICK_TEST.md) for fastest verification.

#### Option 2: Comprehensive Testing (1-2 hours) 📋
Follow [TESTING_CHECKLIST.md](TESTING_CHECKLIST.md) for systematic testing.

#### Option 3: Manual Testing (30 minutes) 🖱️
Use Swagger UI and Frontend for interactive testing.

## 🚀 Quick Start Testing (Recommended First)

### 1. Start Everything
```bash
cd treasure-hunt-analyzer
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec backend python -m app.utils.init_db
```

### 2. Test Backend API
Open http://localhost:8000/docs and test:
- Upload a file
- Run analysis
- View findings

### 3. Test Frontend
Open http://localhost:3000 and:
- View dashboard
- Upload a file
- View findings
- Export a report

## 📊 What to Test

### Critical Path (Must Work)
1. ✅ File upload works
2. ✅ Analysis creates findings
3. ✅ Dashboard displays data
4. ✅ Findings can be viewed
5. ✅ Reports can be exported

### Important Features
1. ✅ Filters work correctly
2. ✅ Charts render properly
3. ✅ Table sorting/search works
4. ✅ Navigation works
5. ✅ Error handling works

### Nice to Have
1. ⚠️ Performance is acceptable
2. ⚠️ UI is responsive
3. ⚠️ Error messages are clear

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Containers won't start
**Solution:**
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose logs
```

### Issue: Database connection error
**Solution:**
```bash
docker-compose exec backend python -m app.utils.init_db
# Check DATABASE_URL in backend/.env
```

### Issue: Frontend can't connect to backend
**Solution:**
- Check backend is running: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
- Check CORS settings in backend
- Verify VITE_API_BASE_URL in frontend

### Issue: No findings created
**Solution:**
- Check file was parsed: View data sources in API
- Check analysis run status
- Review backend logs for errors

## ✅ Success Criteria

**System is working if:**
- ✅ You can upload a file
- ✅ Analysis completes successfully
- ✅ Findings appear in dashboard
- ✅ Charts show data
- ✅ Reports can be exported
