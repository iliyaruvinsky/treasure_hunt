# Skywind Plugin Marketplace

**One unified marketplace for AI coding assistant plugins**

Stop AI hallucinations. Enforce code quality. Standardize workflows across your DevOps teams.

## What is This?

The Skywind Plugin Marketplace is a centralized repository of reusable rule sets (plugins) for AI coding assistants like Claude Code, Cursor, and Windsurf. Each plugin contains rules that guide AI behavior to ensure:

- **Accuracy** - No more hallucinated completions
- **Consistency** - Same standards across all projects
- **Quality** - Enforced best practices
- **Efficiency** - Faster onboarding with pre-made rules

## Why Use Plugins?

### Without Plugins
```
Developer 1: "Claude keeps saying it changed files when it didn't"
Developer 2: "Cursor gave me insecure code patterns"
Developer 3: "I have to keep reminding the AI about our standards"
Manager: "Why are we paying for AI that needs constant supervision?"
```

### With Plugins
```
DevOps Lead: "Install the anti-hallucination plugin"
Team: *installs plugin*
AI: *automatically follows verification rules*
Team: *gets accurate, consistent results*
Manager: "AI costs down 40%, quality up 60%"
```

## Quick Start for DevOps Teams

### Step 1: Clone This Marketplace (One-Time Setup)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iliyaruvinsky/skywind-plugin-marketplace.git
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Your Project

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
```

### Step 3: Install a Plugin

**For Cursor (Windows):**
```powershell
C:\path\to\skywind-plugin-marketplace\scripts\install.ps1 -PluginId anti-hallucination/strict-verification -Tool cursor
```

**For Claude Code (Windows):**
```powershell
C:\path\to\skywind-plugin-marketplace\scripts\install.ps1 -PluginId anti-hallucination/strict-verification
```

**For Cursor (Mac/Linux):**
```bash
/path/to/skywind-plugin-marketplace/scripts/install.sh anti-hallucination/strict-verification --tool cursor
```

**For Claude Code (Mac/Linux):**
```bash
/path/to/skywind-plugin-marketplace/scripts/install.sh anti-hallucination/strict-verification
```

**For Windsurf:**
```bash
# Windows
C:\path\to\skywind-plugin-marketplace\scripts\install.ps1 -PluginId anti-hallucination/strict-verification -Tool windsurf

# Mac/Linux
/path/to/skywind-plugin-marketplace/scripts/install.sh anti-hallucination/strict-verification --tool windsurf
```

### Step 4: Restart Your AI Assistant

Close and reopen Claude Code, Cursor, or Windsurf. The plugin rules will now be active!

## Alternative: Manual Installation

If you prefer not to use the installation script:

1. **Browse to the plugin**: [strict-verification rules](https://github.com/iliyaruvinsky/skywind-plugin-marketplace/blob/main/plugins/anti-hallucination/strict-verification/rules.md)
2. **Copy the content** of `rules.md`
3. **Paste into your project**:
   - **Claude Code**: Create/edit `.claude/rules/strict-verification.md`
   - **Cursor**: Append to `.cursorrules` file in project root
   - **Windsurf**: Create/edit `.windsurf/rules/strict-verification.md`
4. **Restart your AI assistant**

## Featured Plugin: Strict Verification Rules

**The most important plugin for any serious project**

Prevents AI assistants from reporting false completions. Enforces mandatory verification after every file change.

**Before:**
- AI: "I've updated all 10 files"
- Reality: Only 3 files changed
- Cost: Wasted time debugging + API costs

**After:**
- AI: "Let me verify each file..."
- AI: "Confirmed: 3 updated, 7 failed. Fixing the 7 now."
- Result: Accurate work, first time

## For DevOps Teams

### Standardize Across Projects

Install the same plugins across all team projects for consistency:

```bash
# Create a team bundle
for project in project1 project2 project3; do
    cd $project
    ./path/to/marketplace/scripts/install.sh anti-hallucination/strict-verification
    ./path/to/marketplace/scripts/install.sh code-quality/clean-code-enforcer
    cd ..
done
```

### Create Custom Plugins

Have company-specific standards? Create a custom plugin:

```bash
cp -r templates/plugin-template/ plugins/your-category/your-plugin/
# Edit the files
# Commit to marketplace
```

See [docs/plugin-development.md](docs/plugin-development.md) for details.

## FAQ

### Q: Do plugins slow down the AI?
A: No. Rules are guidelines that improve decision-making, not computational overhead.

### Q: Can I use multiple plugins together?
A: Yes! Install as many as you need. They're designed to work together.

### Q: What if a plugin conflicts with my project needs?
A: Fork it and customize it for your needs, or create your own plugin.

### Q: Are plugins secure?
A: Plugins are just markdown files with text rules. Review them before installing.

### Q: Can I sell plugins on this marketplace?
A: Currently this is an open-source marketplace. Commercial plugins can specify their own licenses.

### Q: Does this work with [other AI tool]?
A: If it reads rule files (like .cursorrules), it should work. Test and let us know!
