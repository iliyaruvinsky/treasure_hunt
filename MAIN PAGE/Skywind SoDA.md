## Introducing Skywind SoDA™

Segregation of Duties and Authorizations (SoD) represents one of the most significant challenges in the realm of SAP Audit and Cyber Security. Meeting compliance and curbing internal fraud are pivotal. Yet, with many existing Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance (GRC) solutions falling short, Skywind SoDA™ emerges as a game-changer.

Keeping Segregation of Duties (SoD) and Authorizations under control is a pivotal challenge in SAP Audit and Cyber Security. While existing GRC solutions are expensive, cumbersome, and potentially disrupted by SAP upgrades or migrations to S/4HANA, Skywind SoDA™ emerges as a revolutionary solution.

Engineered to proactively address SoD violations, authorization conflicts, suspicious activities and internal fraud threats, it ensures both SAP compliance and system integrity, presenting a superior alternative to traditional GRC tools and approaches.

### SAP Security Challenge Highlighted

Mismanagement of Segregation of Duties and lax Authorization Controls can do more than just compromise the integrity of SAP systems; they can threaten the entirety of a business. Such oversights pave the way for potential breaches, unauthorized user actions, and internal fraud.

Additionally, as businesses face the rigors of seasonal audit events, the need for stringent controls becomes even more paramount. For businesses, it's imperative to clearly define roles, monitor user access rights, and identify unusual activities.

Yet, how can businesses efficiently and effectively address these challenges? How can they ensure that they safeguard their data, achieve compliance, uphold operational excellence, and successfully navigate the intricate demands of audits?

**Transforming SAP Audit & Cyber Security. Detect, rectify, and stay ahead of SoD violations and risks. Prevent internal fraud and ensure day-to-day compliance, (not just before audits).**

# Securing Your S/4HANA Post-Go-Live Journey with Skywind

**Your Guardian During the Most Vulnerable Transition Period**

## S/4HANA Post Go-Live: When Real Business Meets New Technology

ASUG's 2023 research highlights a complex reality: while S/4HANA promises digital transformation, **57% of organizations are yet to begin their journey**. This careful approach reflects multiple factors: substantial technical complexity, significant investment requirements, resource constraints, and business disruption concerns. As organizations navigate these challenges, ensuring post-go-live stability becomes critical for protecting the S/4HANA investment.

## S/4HANA: Top 4 Benefits for Migration

### Improved Performance
In-memory database and simplified data model enable faster transaction processing and real-time analytics. System response times improve dramatically, supporting higher transaction volumes.
