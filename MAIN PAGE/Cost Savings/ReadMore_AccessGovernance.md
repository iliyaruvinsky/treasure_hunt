# Access Governance

*Convert compliance expenses into measurable security value through automated governance*

## Problems You Face

Your SAP user access controls likely contain dangerous privilege combinations and authorization violations that create security vulnerabilities and compliance exposure. Common access governance problems include users with excessive privileges like SAP_ALL profiles, segregation of duties violations enabling fraud schemes, inactive accounts creating attack vectors, unauthorized access escalation, and poor visibility into who can access what data. Any one of these access control weaknesses can result in security breaches, regulatory penalties, audit remediation costs, and potential business disruption across User Access Management, Authorization Controls, and Segregation of Duties requirements.

## How Skywind Solves This

Skywind's Access Governance solution provides comprehensive SoD analysis, authorization monitoring, and user access control through our SoDA technology. Our platform continuously analyzes user activities, detects authorization violations, identifies excessive privileges, and monitors compliance with segregation of duties requirements in real-time. Instead of discovering access violations during audits, you receive immediate alerts when authorization patterns indicate security or compliance risks, enabling proactive remediation before exposure.

## Platform Simplicity

Implementation requires zero system changesour AI-powered access analysis connects securely to your existing SAP environment with read-only access, typically operational within days. The platform automatically learns your authorization patterns and immediately begins detecting violations and risk indicators. No complex access control reconfigurations, no disruption to user operations, no specialized security expertise required for immediate governance improvement.
