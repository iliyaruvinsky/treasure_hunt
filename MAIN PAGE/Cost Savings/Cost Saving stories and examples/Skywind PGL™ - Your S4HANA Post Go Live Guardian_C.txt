Securing Your S/4HANA Post-Go-Live Journey with Skywind 
Your Guardian During the Most Vulnerable Transition Period 

S/4HANA Post Go-Live: When Real Business Meets New Technology 
ASUG's 2023 research highlights a complex reality: while S/4HANA promises digital transformation, 57% of organizations are yet to begin their journey. This careful approach reﬂects multiple factors: substantial technical complexity, signiﬁcant investment requirements, resource constraints, and business disruption concerns. As organizations navigate these challenges, ensuring post-go-live stability becomes critical for protecting the S/4HANA investment.

Why S/4HANA Post-Go-Live period is the Most Vulnerable Time? 
Once S/4HANA is operational, it enters its most sensitive period where the collision of real business scenarios with new system functionality, untested conﬁguration settings, user inexperience, and evolving security requirements converge into potential operational disruptions - this critical stabilization phase requires comprehensive control, transparency and protection to ensure sustainable business performance.
