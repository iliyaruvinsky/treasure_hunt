SAP Security Challenge Highlighted: 
Mismanagement of Segregation of Duties and lax Authorization Controls can do more than just compromise the integrity of SAP systems; they can threaten the entirety of a business. Such oversights pave the way for potential breaches, unauthorized user actions, and internal fraud. 
Additionally, as businesses face the rigors of seasonal audit events, the need for stringent controls becomes even more paramount. For businesses, it's imperative to clearly define roles, monitor user access rights, and identify unusual activities. 
Yet, how can businesses efficiently and effectively address these challenges? How can they ensure that they safeguard their data, achieve compliance, uphold operational excellence, and successfully navigate the intricate demands of audits? 


Introducing Skywind Segregation of Duties and Authorizations (Skywind SoDA™):
