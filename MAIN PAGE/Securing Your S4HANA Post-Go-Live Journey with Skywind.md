# Securing Your S/4HANA Post-Go-Live Journey with Skywind

**Your Guardian During the Most Vulnerable Transition Period**

---

## Executive Summary

ASUG's 2023 research highlights a complex reality: while S/4HANA promises digital transformation, **57% of organizations are yet to begin their journey**. This careful approach reflects multiple factors: substantial technical complexity, significant investment requirements, resource constraints, and business disruption concerns. As organizations navigate these challenges, ensuring post-go-live stability becomes critical for protecting the S/4HANA investment.

## S/4HANA: Top 4 Benefits for Migration

### 1. Improved Performance
In-memory database and simplified data model enable faster transaction processing and real-time analytics. System response times improve dramatically, supporting higher transaction volumes.

### 2. Faster Access To Analytics
Real-time reporting without data replication, embedded analytics, and instant insights from operational data. Decision-makers get immediate access to business intelligence and call-to-action initiatives.

### 3. Improved Efficiency Over Legacy Systems
Streamlined data structure and automated processes reduce manual work and eliminate redundant steps. Modern interfaces increase user productivity compared to traditional SAP.

### 4. Optimization of Existing Business Processes
Intelligent technologies and simplified workflows enable process optimization, while continuous monitoring ensures operational stability and compliance through early detection of deviations.

## Why S/4HANA Post-Go-Live Period is the Most Vulnerable Time

Once S/4HANA is operational, it enters its most sensitive period where the collision of real business scenarios with new system functionality, untested configuration settings, user inexperience, and evolving security requirements converge into potential operational disruptions. This critical stabilization phase requires comprehensive control, transparency and protection to ensure sustainable business performance.

## Critical S/4HANA Post-Go-Live Vulnerability Factors

### New Technology Adoption Challenges

Your organization faces a critical adaptation period where familiar processes meet unfamiliar technology, creating high-risk operational gaps.

#### Real-Time Processing Risks
- Universal Journal instant postings
- No reconciliation buffer
- Immediate financial impact

#### User Interface Transition
- Multiple access points (Fiori, GUI, APIs)
- Changed process flows
- Higher error probability

### Hidden Organizational Vulnerabilities

The pressure to maintain business continuity leads to quick fixes, emergency access grants, and process workarounds that create invisible but serious security and control gaps.

#### Process Adaptation Period
- Changed workflows
- New approval chains
- Modified master data structures

#### Support Team Pressure
- Emergency access requirements
- Quick-fix tendencies
- Configuration adjustments
