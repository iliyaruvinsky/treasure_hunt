# SAP Basis Cost Savings ROI Calculator Methodology

## Client-Specific Validation Framework for Accurate Cost Savings Assessment

---

## Executive Overview

This methodology provides a systematic approach to calculate precise, client-specific ROI for SAP Basis optimization investments. Unlike industry estimates, this framework uses actual client data to deliver credible, defendable cost savings projections.

**Validation Approach:**

- **Data-Driven:** Uses client's actual SAP environment data
- **Conservative:** Applies conservative multipliers to ensure achievable results
- **Verifiable:** All calculations traceable to specific client inputs
- **Defendable:** Methodology transparent and auditable

## ROI Calculator Framework

### **Phase 1: Baseline Data Collection**

#### **1.1 Current SAP Environment Assessment**

**System Infrastructure Data:**

```
• Number of SAP instances (Production/QA/Dev)
• Server specifications and utilization rates
• Database sizes and growth patterns  
• User count by license type and activity
• Background job volumes and durations
• Historical incident frequency and impact
```

**Current Cost Structure:**

```
• Annual SAP license costs by module/user type
• Infrastructure costs (hardware, cloud, maintenance)
• Administrative personnel costs (FTE allocation)
• Emergency response/crisis management costs
• Estimated downtime costs per hour
```

#### **1.2 Performance Baseline Metrics**

**System Performance Indicators:**

```
• Average system dumps per month
• Long-running job frequency (>24 hours)
• CPU/Memory utilization patterns
• Storage growth and capacity alerts
• RFC connection failure rates
• User authentication issues per month
```

**Operational Efficiency Metrics:**

```
• Manual monitoring time per week (by role)
• Average incident response time
• Emergency procurement frequency
• Help desk tickets related to SAP performance
• Audit findings and compliance gaps
```

### **Phase 2: Risk Assessment & Cost Quantification**

#### **2.1 Downtime Risk Calculation**

**Formula Framework:**

```
Hourly Downtime Cost = (
  (Average User Salary × SAP User Count × Productivity Loss %) +
  (Revenue per Hour × Business Impact %) +
  (Recovery/Emergency Response Costs)
)

Conservative Multiplier: 0.7 (assumes 70% of theoretical impact)
```

**Client Input Requirements:**

- Average loaded salary of SAP users
- Estimated productivity loss during system issues (20-80%)
- Revenue dependence on SAP systems (10-90%)
- Historical emergency response costs

#### **2.2 License Optimization Assessment**

**Inactive User License Recovery:**

```
Annual License Savings = (
  Inactive Users Count × Average License Cost per User
) × Recovery Rate %

Conservative Recovery Rate: 60-80% (accounts for re-activation needs)
```

**Client Input Requirements:**

- Complete user license inventory
- Last login data for all users (180+ days inactive)
- License costs by type and module
- Business justification for retained inactive licenses

#### **2.3 Infrastructure Optimization Value**

**Hardware Cost Avoidance:**

```
Infrastructure Savings = (
  Planned Hardware Purchases × Optimization Delay Factor +
  Emergency Procurement Premium Avoidance
)

Optimization Delay Factor: 6-18 months extended useful life
```

**Client Input Requirements:**

- Current infrastructure refresh plans and budgets
- Historical emergency hardware purchases
- Cloud infrastructure scaling costs
- Capacity planning timeline and costs

### **Phase 3: Operational Efficiency Quantification**

#### **3.1 Administrative Productivity Gains**

**Manual Effort Reduction:**

```
Annual Productivity Savings = (
  Current Manual Monitoring Hours per Week × 52 weeks ×
  Average Administrator Hourly Cost ×
  Automation Efficiency % ×
  Conservative Factor 0.8
)
```

**Client Input Requirements:**

- Time allocation for SAP monitoring by role
- Loaded hourly costs for technical staff
- Current automation level assessment
- Projected efficiency improvements

#### **3.2 Background Job Optimization**

**Processing Efficiency Value:**

```
Job Optimization Value = (
  Long-Running Job Count × Average Excess Runtime Hours ×
  Server Cost per Hour × 
  Optimization Success Rate %
)

Conservative Success Rate: 60-80%
```

**Client Input Requirements:**

- Inventory of long-running jobs (>24 hours)
- Server/cloud compute costs per hour
- Current job optimization efforts
- Historical job performance improvements

### **Phase 4: Risk Mitigation Value**

#### **4.1 Security Incident Prevention**

**Breach Cost Avoidance:**

```
Annual Risk Reduction Value = (
  Industry Average Breach Cost × 
  Client Size Modifier ×
  SAP-Specific Risk Factor ×
  Prevention Effectiveness % ×
  Probability Reduction %
)

Conservative Approach: Use 10-25% of full breach cost for annual risk reduction
```

**Client Input Requirements:**

- Historical security incidents and costs
- Current security assessment results
- Industry-specific risk factors
- Regulatory compliance requirements

#### **4.2 Compliance Risk Mitigation**

**Audit/Compliance Value:**

```
Compliance Value = (
  Previous Audit Findings Remediation Costs +
  Potential Regulatory Fines × Probability % +
  Audit Preparation Time Savings
)
```

**Client Input Requirements:**

- Historical audit costs and findings
- Regulatory compliance requirements
- Previous compliance violations and costs
- Current audit preparation effort
