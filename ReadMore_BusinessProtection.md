# Business Protection
*Eliminate fraud costs and prevent financial losses through early detection*

## Problems You Face

Your SAP environment likely faces significant fraud and cybersecurity threats that can cause substantial financial losses before detection. Common vulnerabilities include vendor payment diversions through bank account manipulation, material conversion fraud ("convert a car to a pencil"), backdated purchase orders bypassing approval controls, one-time vendor schemes using legitimate banking details, and unauthorized financial postings. Any one of these fraud patterns can result in direct monetary losses, investigation costs, regulatory penalties, and reputation damage across Financial Accounting, Master Data Management, Purchasing, Sales, and payment processing areas.

## How Skywind Solves This

Our platform automatically identifies suspicious activities, unusual transaction patterns, vendor manipulation schemes, and authorization violations in real-time. Instead of discovering fraud after financial damage occurs, you receive immediate alerts when activities deviate from normal business patterns, enabling rapid investigation and prevention before losses accumulate.

## Platform Simplicity

Implementation requires zero system changes—our AI-trained fraud detection connects securely to your existing SAP environment with read-only access, typically operational within days. The platform automatically analyzes your financial transaction patterns and immediately begins identifying potential fraud indicators. No complex security configurations, no disruption to business operations, no specialized fraud investigation training required for immediate protection.
