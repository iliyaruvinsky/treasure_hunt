# Risk Management Economics

## What?

Risk Management Economics focuses on transforming compliance and security costs into business value across User Access Management, Authorization Controls, Segregation of Duties, Audit Preparation, Regulatory Compliance, Cybersecurity Governance, and Risk Assessment Activities. This area helps convert compliance costs into business value: can reduce audit preparation effort through automated evidence collection, may prevent regulatory penalties through proactive violation detection, supports breach cost avoidance through proper access controls, helps eliminate excessive privilege risks, and assists in maintaining authorization compliance across all business functions.

## Why?

Risk management becomes expensive when access controls are reactive, user privileges are unmonitored, and compliance violations are discovered during audits rather than prevented proactively. For example, users with excessive privileges like SAP_ALL profiles create security vulnerabilities, segregation of duties violations enable fraud schemes, and inactive user accounts provide attack vectors for unauthorized access. When any one of these control weaknesses is exploited, it often results in security breaches, regulatory penalties, audit remediation costs, and potential business disruption.

## How?

AI-powered access analysis continuously monitors user activities and authorization patterns across your SAP environment, automatically detecting violations and excessive privileges that could become security or compliance risks, and alerting security teams for immediate remediation. Risk-free implementation: read-only monitoring with no system impact, secure connection typically established within days.

## The Value

**Financial:** Breach cost prevention and regulatory penalty avoidance. **Operational:** Automated compliance monitoring and reduced audit effort. **Strategic:** Enhanced security posture and stakeholder confidence. **Risk:** Prevention of access violations before regulatory discovery.
