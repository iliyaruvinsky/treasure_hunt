Use this checklist to systematically test the Treasure Hunt Analyzer system.

## Pre-Testing Setup

- [ ] Docker and Docker Compose installed
- [ ] Sample test files available (4C alerts, SoDA reports)
- [ ] Backend .env file configured
- [ ] Frontend .env file configured (optional)

## 1. System Startup Testing

### Docker Compose
- [ ] Run `docker-compose up -d`
- [ ] Verify all containers start successfully
  ```bash
  docker-compose ps
  ```
- [ ] Check container logs for errors
  ```bash
  docker-compose logs backend
  docker-compose logs frontend
  docker-compose logs postgres
  ```

### Database Initialization
- [ ] Run database initialization
  ```bash
  docker-compose exec backend python -m app.utils.init_db
  ```
- [ ] Verify focus areas are created (should see 6)
- [ ] Verify issue types are created

### Health Checks
- [ ] Backend health endpoint responds
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:8000/health
  ```
- [ ] Frontend loads at http://localhost:3000
- [ ] API docs accessible at http://localhost:8000/docs

## 2. Backend API Testing

### File Upload Endpoint
- [ ] Upload 4C alert Excel file
  ```bash
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/ingestion/upload" \
    -F "file=@path/to/4c-alert.xlsx"
  ```
- [ ] Verify response contains `data_source_id`
- [ ] Verify file is saved to storage
- [ ] Upload SoDA report Excel file
- [ ] Upload PDF file (if available)
- [ ] Upload CSV file (if available)
- [ ] Upload DOCX file (if available)
- [ ] Test error handling (invalid file, missing file)

### Data Source Endpoints
- [ ] List all data sources
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/ingestion/data-sources
  ```
- [ ] Get specific data source by ID
- [ ] Verify data source metadata is correct

### Analysis Endpoints
- [ ] Run analysis on uploaded file
  ```bash
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/analysis/run" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"data_source_id": 1}'
  ```
- [ ] Verify analysis run is created
- [ ] List all analysis runs
- [ ] Get specific analysis run details
- [ ] Verify findings are created

### Findings Endpoint
- [ ] Get all findings
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/analysis/findings
  ```
- [ ] Filter by focus area
  ```bash
  curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/analysis/findings?focus_area=ACCESS_GOVERNANCE"
  ```
- [ ] Filter by severity
- [ ] Filter by status
- [ ] Filter by date range
- [ ] Combine multiple filters

## 3. File Parser Testing

### 4C Alert Parser
- [ ] Parse 4C alert Excel file
- [ ] Verify alert metadata extracted correctly
- [ ] Verify alert records saved to database
- [ ] Check field mappings are correct
- [ ] Test with different 4C alert types

### SoDA Report Parser
- [ ] Parse SoDA report Excel file
- [ ] Verify Parameters sheet parsed
- [ ] Verify KPIs sheet parsed
- [ ] Verify Result sheet parsed
- [ ] Check report metadata extracted

### Other Parsers
- [ ] Test PDF parser (if PDF files available)
- [ ] Test CSV parser
- [ ] Test DOCX parser

## 4. Analysis Engine Testing

### Classification
- [ ] Verify findings classified into correct focus areas

- [ ] Test with different alert types

### Risk Scoring
- [ ] Verify risk scores calculated
- [ ] Check risk levels assigned (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- [ ] Verify risk assessments created
- [ ] Test risk score calculations are reasonable

### Money Loss Calculation
- [ ] Verify money loss calculations (if LLM configured)
- [ ] Check fallback calculations (without LLM)
- [ ] Verify confidence scores
- [ ] Test with different finding types

### Issue Grouping
- [ ] Verify findings grouped by issue type
- [ ] Check aggregated risk scores
- [ ] Verify aggregated money loss

## 5. Frontend Testing
