# Technical Control
*Prevent expensive outages and emergency response costs through proactive infrastructure monitoring*

## Problems You Face

Your SAP technical infrastructure likely operates in reactive mode where system issues are discovered after they impact business operations. Common technical control problems include unmonitored CPU saturation causing system crashes, memory exhaustion leading to application failures, database issues resulting in data corruption, communication system failures disrupting integration, and poor visibility into infrastructure health patterns. Any one of these technical problems can result in expensive downtime, emergency response costs, data recovery expenses, and productivity losses across System Performance, Database Management, Application Stability, Infrastructure Monitoring, and Communication Systems.

## How Skywind Solves This

Skywind's Technical Control solution transforms infrastructure monitoring from reactive to proactive through comprehensive system health tracking. Our platform continuously monitors CPU utilization, memory consumption, database performance, communication stability, and application health patterns in real-time. Instead of discovering technical problems after system failures occur, you receive early warning alerts when performance metrics indicate potential issues, enabling preventive action before costly outages impact business operations.

## Platform Simplicity

Implementation requires zero system changes—our AI-enhanced technical monitoring connects securely to your existing SAP environment with read-only access, typically operational within days. The platform automatically establishes performance baselines and immediately begins detecting anomalies and potential failure patterns. No complex infrastructure reconfigurations, no disruption to system operations, no specialized technical expertise required for immediate infrastructure protection.
