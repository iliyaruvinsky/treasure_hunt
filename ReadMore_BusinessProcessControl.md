# Business Process Control

## What?

Business Process Control focuses on monitoring and optimizing SAP process execution across Procurement, Sales, Logistics, Financial Processes, Inventory Management, Human Resources, Customer Service, Production Planning, Quality Management, Asset Management, and Project Management. This area helps reduce costs across your business process ecosystem: can accelerate revenue through faster transaction completion, may help recover working capital from stuck processes, supports fraud loss prevention through real-time approval monitoring, can reduce manual intervention costs from process breakdowns, and helps maintain compliance to avoid potential audit remediation expenses. Comprehensive monitoring provides visibility across all business processes—offering insights beyond individual transaction types.

## Why?

Business process inefficiencies occur when processes become stuck, approvals bypass controls, or transactions fail to complete properly. For example, Purchase Orders typically involve material accuracy, vendor validation, approval processes, payment terms, and timing controls—when any one of these elements fails or is disrupted, it often creates revenue delays, working capital inefficiencies, compliance violations, and manual intervention costs. Similar patterns can occur across other business processes—Sales Orders, Deliveries, Invoicing, Inventory Movements, Financial Postings—potentially multiplying risk and cost impact across your SAP operation.

## How?

AI-powered process monitoring continuously tracks business events across your SAP environment, automatically detecting deviations that could potentially become costly problems, and alerting responsible teams for timely intervention. Risk-free implementation: read-only monitoring with no system impact, secure connection typically established within days, providing immediate visibility into process health patterns.

## The Value

**Financial:** Revenue acceleration and working capital recovery. **Operational:** Streamlined processes and predictable execution. **Strategic:** Competitive advantage through superior process reliability. **Risk:** Prevention of compliance violations before audit discovery.
