## What is COPE – Control Over Processes and Events?

Hundreds of processes run daily in your SAP systems, with thousands of events taking place. Each event should be seen as a potential problem. By ceasing to function properly, the event will disrupt the continuity of the whole process. When an event becomes "bad", the responsible personnel in organization should be timely informed about it.

## How to measure the ROI from Event Control?

### ROI #1
Save money by revealing direct losses from outdated or incorrect business activities

### ROI #2
Save money by early detection and continuous control upon business bottlenecks

### ROI #3
Save time by responding to the incidents faster

### ROI #4
Save time and money to the Stakeholders by timely providing them with critical data

### ROI #5
Save time to IT and Business by developing ad-hoc reports much faster and without coding

## ROI Examples

### ROI #1 - Save money by revealing direct losses
**Problem:** Outdated (incorrect) costing of products sold
**Background:** Outdated products costing can be caused by a variety of reasons
**Outcomes:** Incorrect costing is a cause for possible money loss in multiple deals, let alone company's reputation which also could be at stake

### ROI #2 – Save money by early detection
**Problem:** Product dimensions were changed in material master record in a period between order creation and goods issue
**Background:** Global manufacturer with thousands of deliveries carried out daily
**Outcomes:** Problems in shipping (e.g., not enough space in track or container). Changes in product dimensions should be continuously monitored

### ROI #3 – Save time by responding faster
**Problem:** Saving precious operation time of Basis team
**Background:** Large healthcare services provider with thousands of employees having multiple SAP instances heavily exploited
**Outcomes:** Using the Basis Alert Pack, the customer reports at least one hour saved daily for each team member – 5 members. 1200 hours annually worth at least $120K per year

### ROI #4 – Save time for stakeholders
**Problem:** Purchase Order has been waiting for approval of a specific person for too long
**Background:** This exception indicates that the process of PO approvals is not functioning as expected
**Outcomes:** A well-timed targeted reminder significantly reduces the approval time and increases the speed of the purchase process

### ROI #5 – Save time on development
**Problem:** Each new reporting requirement means: new BI or ABAP development project
**Background:** Creating new customized alerts or reports in SAP means new reporting requirements and a new coding project
