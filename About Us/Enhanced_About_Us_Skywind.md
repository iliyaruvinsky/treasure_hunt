# About Skywind: The Science of Data, Art of Business

## Transforming SAP Complexity Into Competitive Advantage

In the complex world of SAP operations, where critical business processes can be compromised by hidden vulnerabilities, fraud, and inefficiencies, Skywind emerged with a revolutionary vision: to make the invisible visible, the complex simple, and the risky secure.

We are the leading provider of intelligent SAP monitoring solutions, specializing in fraud detection, business process monitoring, segregation of duties compliance, authorization governance, and technical performance optimization. Our philosophy is simple yet powerful: combine the **Science of Data** with the **Art of Business** to deliver actionable insights that drive real business transformation.

## Our Story: From Complex Challenges to Elegant Solutions

### **The Problem We Solved**

Traditional SAP monitoring focused on IT metrics—response times, CPU usage, interfaces—while business-critical risks remained invisible. Organizations were drowning in technical data but starving for business insights. Critical vulnerabilities like suspicious material movements, unauthorized vendor changes, and self-approved purchase orders went undetected until costly audits revealed the damage.

### **Our Innovation: COPE Philosophy**

Skywind revolutionized SAP management through our **COPE (Control Over Processes and Events)** philosophy. We recognized that hundreds of processes run daily in SAP systems with thousands of events, each representing potential risk. Our approach transforms reactive monitoring into proactive control, turning corporate data into precise call-to-action intelligence.

Instead of simply collecting data, we deliver:

- **Preventive Control** that stops issues before they impact business
- **Detective Control** that reveals hidden problems and fraud
- **Compensatory Control** that addresses process gaps
- **Corrective Control** that guides rapid resolution
