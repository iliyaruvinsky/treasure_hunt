Preventing Financial LossesIn Your SAP®
 
 
We often hear stories of how stressed salespeople are, willing to bend the rules in order to reach targets or out of fear to lose their jobs. One of our leading European clients suspected that he was subject to manipulation by a sales person, who negotiated a large stock order for appliances with the customer at the end of the fiscal period. In return for a back-credit he would lower the prices for all accumulated purchases and guarantee full pay back for stock return during next fiscal period. On the system it appeared as returns with credits or pay-backs, costing the company extra transportation costs, lower sales prices and inflated sales commissions. 
 
Within minutes of deploying 4C™ platform we uncovered a total of $190K “suspicious credits”. As a result we added a set of alerts that exposed customers who received credits starting with a configurable transaction threshold of $20K. 
  
By using 4C™ our client caught a systematic and creative method of manipulating the system in order to increase sales commissions and achieve sales targets. The impact of deploying 4C™ platform was immediate and maximized real-time control, preventing these types of activities from reoccurring.
