# Resource Optimization

## What?

Resource Optimization focuses on turning underutilized SAP resources into competitive advantages across Licensing Management, Infrastructure Allocation, Capacity Planning, Storage Optimization, Compute Resource Distribution, User Account Management, and System Utilization Analytics. This area helps transform resource waste into competitive advantage: can eliminate inactive license costs through systematic user management, may optimize infrastructure utilization to defer capacity expansion, supports intelligent allocation based on actual demand patterns, helps reduce compute and storage waste, and assists in aligning costs with real business requirements across all resource categories.

## Why?

Resource waste occurs when infrastructure capacity is misaligned with actual demand, licenses are underutilized, and planning decisions are based on theoretical peaks rather than real usage patterns. For example, inactive user licenses may continue consuming budget for 180+ days, server resources might be underutilized while new capacity is purchased, or storage allocation may not reflect actual business requirements. When any one of these resource inefficiencies persists, it typically results in higher infrastructure costs, unnecessary licensing expenses, and suboptimal return on SAP investments.

## How?

Intelligent resource analysis continuously tracks utilization patterns and demand across your SAP environment, automatically identifying optimization opportunities and waste elimination potential, and providing data-driven insights for strategic resource decisions. Risk-free implementation: read-only monitoring with no system impact, secure connection typically established within days.

## The Value

**Financial:** License cost reduction and infrastructure optimization. **Operational:** Better resource allocation and capacity planning. **Strategic:** Competitive advantage through efficient resource management. **Risk:** Prevention of resource waste before budget impact.
