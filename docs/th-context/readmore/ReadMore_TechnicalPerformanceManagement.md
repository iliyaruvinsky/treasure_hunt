# Technical Performance Management

## What?

Technical Performance Management focuses on preventing costly system outages and transforming monitoring from reactive to proactive across System Performance, Database Management, Application Stability, Infrastructure Monitoring, Communication Systems, Basis Operations, Development Environments, and Business Warehouse Performance. This area helps prevent costly system outages and optimize technical operations: can detect performance issues before they cause failures, may prevent system crashes through early warning systems, supports faster incident resolution through automated detection, helps eliminate emergency response costs, and assists in maintaining optimal system performance across all technical infrastructure.

## Why?

Technical problems become expensive when system issues are detected reactively, performance degradation goes unmonitored, and infrastructure failures require emergency response instead of preventive maintenance. For example, unmonitored CPU saturation may cause system crashes, memory exhaustion can lead to application failures, or database issues might result in data corruption. When any one of these technical problems occurs without early warning, it typically results in expensive downtime, emergency response costs, data recovery expenses, and productivity losses across the user base.

## How?

AI-enhanced technical monitoring continuously tracks system performance metrics across your SAP environment, automatically detecting patterns that indicate potential failures or performance degradation, and alerting technical teams for preventive action. Risk-free implementation: read-only monitoring with no system impact, secure connection typically established within days.

## The Value

**Financial:** Downtime prevention and emergency response cost elimination. **Operational:** Stable System Performance and improved User Experience. **Strategic:** Reliable infrastructure supporting business growth. **Risk:** Prevention of technical failures before business impact.
